# My Artists App
This Expo.io app automatically connects to userâ€™s Spotify accounts and utilizes my custom backend API (in another repository) to retrieves all the user's favorite artists. It then displays local concerts/clubs featuring these artists.
Technologies include: React Native, Expo and Redux


## Backend
Needs the backend running. Currently one is running at 'my-artists-app.herokuapp.com'
Backend source code is here: https://github.com/samkovaly/SpotifyAPIMusicProfile
Need a consistent master key to connect the app to it's backend.

## Setup
1. Pull from git hub
2. Get NPM & Node.js (https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) (tested on 12.16.1)
3. npm install -g expo-cli
4. "expo login" if you have an expo account
5. Get yarn if you don't have it (https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#windows-stable)
6. run "yarn install"
7. make file 'APIConfig.js' in the main directory and export API_IP and API_MASTER_KEY that correlate to the backend.
8. expo run
9. run via expo app on your device.
